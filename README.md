<h1>CumminsEcmEditor</h1>
<h3> An experimental editor for the Cummins ecm calibrations. </h3>

<h4>Introduction:</h4>

This project orginally began as it became clear how locked behind a paywall the diesel tuning community is.I have a unique Cummins Turbo Diesel engine that I want to tune myself.  The available tools are missing
parameters for the engine, or do not match up correctly to the part number of my ecm.

So... the solution... through months of research, agonizing over fine details, writing and re-writing...
is rewriting again!

<h4>Purpose:</h4>

To correctly load, modify and save the Engine Calibration to a new file that can be installed with either
an orginal Cummins tool, a Dealership tool (ie Nissan Consult III), or an aftermarket tool (ie Ez Lynk).
